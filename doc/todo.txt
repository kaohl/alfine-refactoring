[TODO]
  Manage output. Make it possible to toggle output from different parts of the
  refactoring process.

[TODO]
  Consider if we should prevent opportunities from being selected more than once.
  Because the framework is restarted between each refactoring we would have to
  track used refactorings in a file between runs. (We can let the `Supply` know
  about the file and exclude any opportunities that have already been tried so
  that the supplier only contains untried opportunities.)

[TODO]
  Add and propagate seeds specified on the framework command-line. Use one seed
  parameter for sorting and another for selection.

[TODO]
  Extract method refactoring should sort all opportunities by interval length
  and then draw a random interval length and a random opportunity of that length.
